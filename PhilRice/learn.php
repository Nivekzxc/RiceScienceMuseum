<h4>Collections</h4>

<p>Our collections include material culture of rice-farming communities such as implements used from land preparation to post-harvest production, rice seeds, photographs, and artwork. (Link to database)</p>

<h4>Mobile museum</h4>
<p>Despite the depth and richness of learning offered by the Rice Science Museum, the public cannot maximize these benefits owing to its location. To bring rice learning experience closer to wider audience, the museum offers mobile exhibits. On its initial launching on Nov. 21, 2014 at Luneta Park, Manila, it has reached about 20,000 students and passersby. </p>

<p>Study shows that the mobile exhibits had influenced the cognitive and affective learning of the visitors. These learnings were indicated through asking sequence of related questions—clarifying, probing, and challenging questions; expressing deeper appreciation on the production of rice and how difficult it is to grow rice; showing emotional response to the exhibit; and increasing empathy of other people’s beliefs and actions.</p>
<p>Help the farmers become more aware of modern farming or encourage your students to appreciate the farmers and value rice by bringing the museum to your farming communities or schools. Email us at ricesciencemuseum@philrice.gov.ph. </p>

<h4>Workshop</h4>
<p>At the Rice Science Museum, we utilize art for greater cause. We conduct art workshops as our way of engaging the youth on food security, which is a challenge in the Philippines as we only scored 49.4 out of 100 points in the Global Food Security Index indicating that our food supply may not be enough. Our growing old population of farmers, averaging 55 years old, also threatens our food production.</p>

<p>In an attempt to create a consciousness of agriculture, we implement rice science and art camp. Our topics include The Journey of Rice, Rice and Health, and Youth in Agriculture. We include exposure trip at the gene bank and FutureRice and experimental fields. Art lecture include basic of shadow, lights, and forms.</p>
<p>Evaluation results show that our workshop highly improved the understanding of rice, appreciation of rice farming, and rice culture. It has also improved their artistic skill and has signified their interest working in agriculture in the future.</p>
