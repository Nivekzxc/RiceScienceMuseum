<h4 class="text-center"><b>Rice...
Now we know it,
Now we don’t</b></h4>
<h5><i>Charisma Love B. Gado</i></h5>

<p class="text-justify">There’s too much familiarity with the permeating rice that, oftentimes, we do not even raise an eyebrow about it. We had thought everything about our staple food was obvious.<br><br>

But do not be shocked with Nap Enrick, Grade 5 pupil in Muntinlupa City, who could tell you cooked rice comes from “water hyacinth,” which abounds in the Laguna Bay.<br><br>

“My classmates and I grew up thinking that rice is from water hyacinth. We just learned of its true origin after the visit of the PhilRice museum staff,” Nap said.<br><br>

Nap’s school doesn’t teach rice science. Science literacy in the country remains low as 6th graders showed 67.2% achievement rates, short of the 75% passing rate.<br> 

<p id="demo" class="collapse text-justify">
PhilRice’s Floper Gershwin Manuel, museum researcher and educator, said that schools have yet to cover more areas on science. Thus, the need to complement knowledge acquisition through informal learning such as visits to museums and science centers.
<br><br>
Museum visitors act on new knowledge
<br><br>
Manuel says the Rice Science Museum of PhilRice performs social tasks beyond its traditional role as an educational institution, in which contents are static and merely awaiting the public to view. Since its re-launching in 2014, the museum promotes the history, science, technology, and culture of rice, and its arts through changing thematic displays. The museum also brings itself closer to the public through mobile exhibits. These initiatives of the museum make knowledge on rice more accessible, especially in the urban areas.
<br><br>
The museum thus far had presented four major thematic and two special exhibits to the public, including Lovelife with Rice, Bountiful Harvest, Colors of Rice, and Transformations in Progress. The displays showed the deep connection between Filipinos and rice; the practices and technologies that have brought abundance to traditional and modern farming; the staple food’s healthy aspect; and the changing landscape from the pre-colonial to the modern world. The special exhibits featured Palay Kamalayan to raise awareness on the culture of rice and the social issues affecting it; and the Botong Francisco: A Nation Imagined – courtesy of the Ayala
Museum, to encourage the youth to think of their role in feeding the nation. 
<br><br>
Elementary and high school students in Metro Manila who viewed one of the exhibits said they eat white rice at least thrice a day. They were unaware of the pigmented rices such as the red, black, and purple already sold in the supermarkets, and they mistook brown rice or whole rice for fried rice or suman.
<br><br>
“In my visit, I learned that eating better rice forms can make me strong while the white rice I was accustomed to is not that healthy. Polishing rice removes almost all of the nutrients so I will request my mother to buy brown rice,” Rubylyn Romero, 11, said.
<br><br>
Teener Jetzka Abogado said that as a future doctor, “I am happy to learn that rices with darker pigments are healthier. Black rice makes us strong and for us to be healthy, let us eat the colored rice. Ignorance of this would damage our body system.” 
<br><br>
Abogado said she will convince her family to consume pigmented rice as well. Farmers also benefit from the science they learn in the museum. The Transformations in Progress exhibit taught them the science of ecological engineering, an emerging concept in rice production, which promotes the use of cultural techniques to increase the populations of beneficial insects and parasitoids.
<br><br>
Victoria Pancho, 61, of the Science City of Munoz, said she did not know that pesticide use can be minimized by planting flowering plants such as biddens and butter daisies along the rice paddy dikes. The flowers attract helpful insects that multiply fast, then defeat the insect pests.
<br><br>
“I’m glad I visited the museum where I learned about this concept. My farm hand sprays pesticides more than five times per cropping season that cost about P5,000. I’ll start planting these flowers when I get home,” the farm manager for nine years said.
<br><br>
<i>Museum as science aide</i><br><br>

Ana Delicado of the Portuguese academe said that the representation of scientific results is at the core of most science museums. She said there is debate on whether scientific museums can teach science or merely create an appetite for it, but museums work as “showcases” for scientific disciplines through artefacts, images, and texts.
<br><br>
In a recent worldwide review of The European Network of Science Centres and Museums, it was found that interactive science exhibitions increase visitors’ knowledge and understanding of science; promote trust and understanding between the public and the scientific community; and provide memorable learning experiences, which can have a lasting impact on attitudes and behaviors.
<br><br>
Diadem Gonzales-Esmero, curator of the Rice Science Museum, said that museums provide a popular venue to promote the findings of scientific researches.
<br><br>
The curator said that based on their study on social influence, displays or exhibits are starting points of farmer-to farmer conversations and exchanges on best farming practices. Farmer-visitors relate the best farming practices to their fellow farmers, then gradually show interest in adopting technologies displayed in the museum.
<br><br>
“Usually, farmers show interest in buying certified seeds because they learned in one of the sections that good-quality seeds will produce healthy seedlings,” Esmero said.
<br><br>
Children giving premium on their health and farmers expressing interest in improving their farm practices are just few of the stories that prove science literacy is “much more than the memorization or even comprehension of scientific facts and principles.” 
<br><br>
New knowledge on science, no matter how little, can help change one’s life.

<h4 class="text-center"><b>Resources of Hope </b></h4>
<h5><i>Charisma Love B. Gado</i></h5>

<p class="text-justify">
After typhoon Mario battered Ilocos Norte in 2014, Laoag City farmer Ricarte Corpuz was convinced that climate change is real.
<br><br>
“We were quite worried as we were not used to long hours of intense rain. Mario inflicted a P76-million damage on our province,” the 65-year-old citizen recalled.
<br><br>
With his stormy experience, Corpuz is now part of the 2015 data from Pew Research Center showing that seven in ten Filipinos consider climate change a “very serious
problem.” 
<br><br>
Mike Davis, writer, urban theorist, and historian, says “our world, our old world that we have inhabited for the last 12,000 years, has ended, even if no newspaper in North America or Europe has yet printed its scientific obituary.”

<p id="story2" class="collapse text-justify">
Climate change has so impacted the globe that by 2030, some 1.4 million Filipinos will be facing a higher risk of hunger due to lower agricultural production, while 690 million children worldwide will be living in areas most exposed to such change.
<br><br>
<i>Catching values in museums</i>
<br><br>
With the undeniable urgency in addressing climate change, scholar David Turnbull contends that “new values must be planted and nurtured to inspire people to become citizens and act on climate change.” Such values can be grown in museums.
<br><br>
To execute COP21 agreements by broadening public engagement with climate issues, the Climate Museum in New York City was created and is hoped to be established in six years. Miranda Massie, its executive director, said they rely on the transformative power of museums, which has been documented in studies.
<br><br>
“Reduced misconceptions, improved knowledge, strengthened critical thinking, deepened tolerance and empathy, and elevated interest and engagement are [just few of the influences] on the museum visitors,” she said.
<br><br>
<i>Working on behavior change</i>
<br><br>
Certain farmers, according to Corpuz, at times picture an apocalyptic view of the world with water scarcity, perfect storms, and extended dry spells mostly threatening their survival.
<br><br>
To help farmers adapt to climate change, the Rice Science Museum of PhilRice will present climate-smart solutions in its upcoming fourth exhibit titled, “Transformations in Progress.” To be launched in April, the museum will highlight climate-ready rice varieties, ecological engineering, and diversified farming.
<br><br>
“These technologies will be presented through dioramas to be complemented with audio aids. When things are seen and heard, farmers tend to more easily apply the technologies,” Floper Gershwin Manuel, museum curator, said.
<br><br>
The National Museum, through the initiative of Sen. Loren Legarda, also launched in 2013 the “Biodiversity, Rice, and Climate Change” exhibit to highlight the need to address biodiversity loss and climate change in relation to rice production.
<br><br>
“Filipinos are rice-loving citizens... The sad fact, however, is that our rice production is greatly affected by the warming climate. If we want to continue enjoying eating rice with our dishes, we have to do something to address the risks brought about by climate change and the threat of further rise in global temperature,” Legarda said.
<br><br>	
Moreover, the Museo Pambata is raising the awareness of children aged 2-12 years old on their role in creating a better environment. The interactive museum based in Manila involves children in lessening the effects of climate change by setting up the Environment and Kalikasan Room, annually hosting the Earth Day, and leading the 2011 Children’s Museum Conference, which focused on addressing climate change.
<br><br>
“Museo Pambata, as a leading advocate for children, takes a stand that we must act for the benefit of our children. But much more so, for children to be actively involved in taking care of our planet,” executive director Maricel Montero said.
<br><br>
In designing the contents of the theme rooms, focused group discussions are conducted with public school pupils, usually those in their 4th grade, and ask them on the environment-related topics they wish to know or concepts they hardly understand. In previous exhibits, the concepts of greenhouse effect, El Niño, or La Niña; rice and the environment; and harmful and beneficial insects were featured.
<br><br>
“We aim for the theme room to change children’s behaviors. For example, the displays about the insects will enable children to realize that even the smallest creatures help in keeping the balance of our environment. This also empowers children who, as small and young as they are, can also help care for Mother Earth,” Montero said.
<br><br>
<i>Citizens’ media</i>
<br><br>
Juan Francisco Salazar in his paper titled, The Mediations of Climate Change: Museums as Citizens’ Media, said that museums play a significant role in climate change literacies by fostering learning on climate change science, justice, and action.
<br><br>
Museums, he said, do not only transfer new information but also transmit climate change action. Think of Corpuz who is excited to learn about the climate-ready varieties when he visits the Rice Science Museum, or the parents who have informed the Museo Pambata that after going to the museum, their children had begun practicing the simple habits of using water in a glass while tooth-brushing and writing on paper back-to-back. Indeed, “museums are resources of hope as they encourage individuals to rethink their engagement with their natural and human environments.”

<h4 class="text-center"><b>Seat of the Muses</b></h4>
<h5><i>Charisma Love B. Gado</i></h5>

<p class="text-justify">
A middle-aged happy man entered a 320-m2 building seated at the country’s lead agency in rice research and development in Nueva Ecija. Wiping away some sweat he got from the 360Celsius heat, the rice crop display accenting in a bench first catches his attention. 
<br><br>
Curious, but quite shy and hesitant. His eyes move from the grains to the woman standing across him. Timidly, he asks, “Ma’am, what do you call this variety? It’s grains are 50% more than the variety I planted this season. I want to plant it.” His excitement made him forget that it was hotter inside than outside the building.
<br><br>
Mang William, farmer, 53, was inside the Rice Science Museum. Re-launched in Sept. 2014, the museum offers deeper appreciation of the 2,000-year journey of rice production in the country and is used as unique extension tool to help raise farmers’ competitiveness. The museum enriches farmers’ knowledge through engaging experiences as most of its sections allow visitors to touch and explore the artifacts and displays. 
<br>

<p id="story3" class="collapse text-justify">
Diadem Esmero, proponent of the new Rice Science Museum, said it was reformatted in a dynamic way to help farming communities keep up with the steady generation of knowledge in the rice and science and development sector. 
<br><br>
“Previously, the museum was set-up to raise awareness on rice culture, but focused only on few collections about the Cordilleras; limiting rice appreciation in the highlands. With our present setup, knowledge is always keep fresh with our transitory exhibits every six months,” she said.
<br><br>
<b>Unique extension tool</b> 
<br><br>
In its Greek form, mouseion, meant "Seat of the Muses" and “designated a philosophical institution or a place of contemplation.” As Seat, Hans Aarsman said in a 2011 book titled, More than Worth it: The Social Significance of Museums that the museum has an indispensable role in a society owing to its educational value through informal learning and discovery. It also has experience value as “visiting museums is fun and that museums provide the visitors with the freedom to think and reflect, identity, order, and memory.”
<br><br>
In a report prepared by BritainThinks for Museums Association in March 2013, museum-goers perceive that “creating knowledge for, and about, society” is one of the most essential roles of the museum. Respondents said that that museums provide equal education for everyone through knowledge creation and knowledge sharing. They also view museums as more trusted sources of information or learning for adults than the government and the media. 
<br><br>
As the Rice Science Museum experienced, farmers oftentimes express interest in sharing the information they learned from their visit. A La Union farmer in his 40s once asked the museum guide about the period when the traditional varieties became extinct. His belief, traditional means non-existent. He was surprised to know that the varieties are still planted in Ifugao, Aurora, Palawan, and Mindoro. A farmer for more than half of his life, he said that he has yet to see traditional varieties with long awns – an information that he was eager to impart to his family and friends when he returns home. 
<br><br>
Meanwhile, a farmer-visitor who identified himself only as Rogel Comesario, 53, said that the knowledge he gained from the museum can help him become a better rice grower. 
<br><br>
“I love my first museum visit experience. I learned about the high-yielding varieties, which I can try in our area and the importance of maintaining biodiversity in my farm. I also became interested to buy the portable rice mill, which I can use produce our household rice supply,” the farmer who rated his museum visit as excellent said.
<br><br>
The potentials of the Rice Science Museum as extension modality is concluded in a 2003 paper titled, Measuring the Outcomes and Impact of Learning in Museums, Archives and Libraries. Researchers from the Research Centre for Museums and Galleries in the United Kingdom found that museum goers can gain the following skills:  intellectual such as thinking critically and analytically; information management skills such as locating and evaluating information; and social skills such as meeting people, introducing others, and remembering names.  They also found that museums can effect change in attitudes and values, and can increase motivation. 
<br><br>
<b>The Rice Science Museum</b>
<br><br>
Published studies about the museums regarded these institutions as social investment as they are powerful influencers in a country’s culture. Museums were highly esteemed as shown during the Nuremberg Trials after World War II when Nazi officials were sentenced to death for destruction of cultural property.
<br><br>
In its re-launching, the Rice Science Museum highlighted rice science, art, and technology through its eight sections: material culture of rice-farming communities in the country, labor-and cost-reducing machines, and rice seeds. Collections covering the species found in the rice environment, rice ecosystem, rice grains, and art works were also exhibited. Contents were updated during bi-annual transitory exhibits titled, Lovelife with Rice from Sept. 2015 to Feb. this year and Bountiful Harvest, March to June. Colors of Rice, an exhibit focusing on the health and nutrition aspects of rice, kicks-off in July.
<br><br>
The research of Floper Gershwin E. Manuel and his team found that farmers consider appreciating how the rice grows and appreciating rice culture in the Philippines as their most satisfying experience. Meanwhile, their most liked displays include the rice material culture and machines. The study, presented during the University Museums and Collections at the University of Sto. Tomas in May 2015, also showed that learning occurs through memory recall and sharing of previous knowledge and experiences. 
<br><br>
Indicators of learning during the visits include discussing the contents of the exhibits with supporting arguments and being able to connect the contents with their experiences in everyday lives. A strong indicator of learning is also manifested by the spontaneous expression of their sense of identity with the other people and communities.
<br><br>
A certain Editha Cagasan, 50, said, “After my visit, I became familiar with the rice production areas and the yield across regions. These information inspire me to attain higher harvest.”
<br><br>
<b>Spreading out</b> 
<br><br>
To bring rice learning experience closer to wider audience, PhilRice launched a Mobile Rice Science Museum in November 2014, in which about 20,000 urban dwellers viewed the exhibit within five days. In farming communities, the mobile museum was pilot-tested in March 2015 during the week-long centennial celebration of the Romblon State University. Farmers said that the museum made them aware of the new varieties and modern machines.
<br><br>
Indeed, the museum when used in delivering extension services, transcends the Seat of the Muses from its poetic form. From being a mind ‘s lair where knowledge only lurks to a haven where knowledge possesses the open-mind. And when knowledge is consumed, the museum creates more meaning to the lives in farming communities. An author had said it well, “Isn’t the purpose of a museum is to relate our memories with such sincerity as to transform individual happiness into a happiness all can share?”
